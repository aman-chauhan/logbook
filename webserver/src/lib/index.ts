/**
 * Library barrel exports for the Logbook web client.
 *
 * This file is intentionally minimal for educational clarity. Components
 * can import directly from specific files rather than through barrel exports:
 *
 * - import { api } from '$lib/api' - API client for backend communication
 * - import { currentUser } from '$lib/stores/user' - User state management
 *
 * Future expansion: Add barrel exports here if the project grows and
 * convenience imports become valuable (e.g., export { api } from './api').
